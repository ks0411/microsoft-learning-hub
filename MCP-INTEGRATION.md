# MCP Integration Guide

## What Changed

Your Microsoft Learning Hub now uses **real MCP (Model Context Protocol) integration** with Microsoft Learn documentation to generate dynamic exam questions.

## How It Works

### 1. Dynamic Question Generation
- Questions are now generated from live Microsoft Learn documentation
- Content is always up-to-date with the latest Microsoft Fabric documentation
- Questions include current dates and references to official documentation

### 2. Question Sources
- **Primary**: Live Microsoft Learn content via MCP integration
- **Fallback**: Reduced set of 5 static questions per exam (down from 15)
- **Total**: Typically 9-12 questions per exam (6-9 MCP + 5 static)

### 3. How to Identify MCP Questions

**Dynamic (MCP) Questions:**
- Question IDs: `dp600-mcp-semantic-1722528000000` (contain timestamp)
- Tags: `['mcp-generated', 'microsoft-learn', 'live-content', 'updated-8/1/2025']`
- References: Live Microsoft Learn URLs
- Content: Includes current dates and "According to latest Microsoft documentation"

**Static (Fallback) Questions:**
- Question IDs: `dp600-static-001` 
- Tags: `['static-fallback', ...]`
- Content: Fixed reference questions
