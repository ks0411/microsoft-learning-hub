# Microsoft Fabric Learning Portal - MCP Integration Guide

## 🎯 Real Microsoft Docs Integration Complete!

Your learning portal now has **live integration** with Microsoft Documentation through the MCP (Model Context Protocol) server. Here's what's been implemented:

### ✅ What's Working Now

1. **Enhanced MCPQuestionService** (`src/services/mcpQuestionService.ts`)
   - Real MCP Microsoft Docs search integration
   - Dynamic question generation from live Microsoft Learn content
   - Fallback to comprehensive 15+ question bank per exam
   - Smart logging to show data sources

2. **Dedicated MCP Integration Service** (`src/services/mcpIntegration.ts`)
   - Direct connection to Microsoft Documentation MCP server
   - AI-powered question generation from official study guides
   - Content analysis for DP-600 and DP-700 specific topics
   - Connection status monitoring

3. **Visual Status Indicator** (`src/pages/ExamPage.tsx`)
   - Live indicator showing "Live Microsoft Docs" vs "Comprehensive Bank"
   - Real-time MCP connection status
   - Clear user feedback about data sources

### 🔧 How It Works

```typescript
// The service now automatically:
1. Check for MCP Microsoft Docs availability

3. Generate dynamic questions from official documentation
4. Combine with comprehensive question bank for robust coverage
5. Show status indicator in the UI
```

### 🌐 MCP Integration Architecture

```
User Request → MCPQuestionService → MCPIntegrationService → Microsoft Docs MCP Server
                                ↓
                         Real-time Questions ← Live Microsoft Learn Content
                                ↓
                         Enhanced Question Bank (15+ base + MCP generated)
```
